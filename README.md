# MESRGAN
It was my Undergrad project as an attempt to reduce no. of parameters to approx. 1/3rd of those used in ESRGAN model for image superresolution while preserving the visual quality. Results not satisfactory! The visual quality was worsened due to development of artifacts. However was successful in reducing the no. of parameters while maintaining PSNR of 32.
